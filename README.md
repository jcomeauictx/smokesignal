An idea for permissionless data communications

Two laptops facing each other, cameras on. One flashes a QR code to the
other. If the other sees it, it flashes the same code back, or it flashes
a code of its own data plus a hash of the data it saw.

A community of laptops in windows could have a mesh of these, with houses
with more than one computer serving as routers.

Scaling wider, telescopes and large screens could potentially have
point-to-point links many kilometers distant.
